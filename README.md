Purpose of the Project

I developed a simple calculator using Python that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and select an operation. It utilizes functions to handle each operation, ensuring clean and organized code. After performing the calculation, the result is displayed to the user. Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs, such as division by zero. The calculator runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit. This project enhanced my understanding of functions, user input, and control flow in Python programming.
